	These are my files for codeforces rounds

	To use them make:
		- copy the script (there are 2 ways to do that, as follows):
			- write in your terminal "git clone https://github.com/vladtarniceru/codeforces" , "cd codeforces" .
			or
			- copy "new" file in your folder, then "chmod +x new".
		- to create a new round write in your terminal "./new" , then "cd new"
		- to open all the problems from a round write "./link" and tell the round id
		- to run the tests write "./test" , then enter the round id and the problem name (from 'A' to 'E')
	
	
	If you find, report any bugs at "vladtarniceru@yahoo.com"
